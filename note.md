Start off with : npx create-react-app photo-port

npx - package runner tool simplifies the installation and runing process of devDependencies. Rather than installing CRA and then running i, npx will try using the local installation, if there isnt any, npx will install it for us.

create-react-app - is the created source code, photo-port is just the name

npm install the updated package and npm start

react-dom package - serves as the entry point to the DOM to render the JSX by using the virtual DOM.
